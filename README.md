#### Suggestions on how to improve [Harmonium documentation](https://harmonium.revelry.co/)

## 1. Installation and Setup section

### current issues: 

#### 1. For less experienced developers, itâ€™s unclear how to import sass files and replicate the examples locally.

#####  1. suggestions:

* On installation section, add `npm install --save node-sass` instruction  and/or 
link tutorials on how to import sass stylesheets into react app. (https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_sass.asp)
* Remind users to create a sass file in the directory if they haven't already done so.
* Add more detail on the sass file instruction.

current:
```scss
/* myapp.scss */
@import 'wherever-your-styles-live/color-palette';
@import 'wherever-your-styles-live/harmonium-settings';
@import 'wherever-your-styles-live/harmonium-component-settings';
@import '~/harmonium/scss/app';
/* your styles here; */
```
to:
```scss
/* myapp.scss */
@import 'wherever-your-styles-live/color-palette'; // For example: @import './styles/color-palette'
@import 'wherever-your-styles-live/harmonium-settings';  // @import './styles/harmonium-settings'
@import 'wherever-your-styles-live/harmonium-component-settings'; // @import './styles/harmonium-component-settings'
@import '~/harmonium/scss/app';
/* your styles here; */
```
###### Personal experience with the issue: I got stuck with `wherever-your-styles-live` for a while. Might just be my own problem. Could help someone like me to follow the instruction more easily by adding an example
* Remind them to import the scss file in their react app like they would with css files. Presumably in index.js.

#### 2. The link for downloading the starter settings in the middle of the document does not work.

##### 2. suggestions:
current: 
```
Harmonium includes !default values for color-palette and harmonium-settings vars. You can download the starter settings here (which include color-palette.scss and harmonium-settings.scss) and easily view/edit variables to fit your project
```
The hypelink on `here` directs users to page not found.

* Fix: replace the link with the one on side Nav that's working properly.


 #### 3. No direct navigation to the installation and setup page on side navbar.

#####  3. suggestions:

###### Personal experience: Without realizing the logo redirects you to the Installation and Setup page, I had to resort to the instructions on Github and NPM to find the information.

* Fix: Add a direct link of the Setup page to the side Nav.


## 2. Miscellanous Section

### current issues: 

1. Not all sections of the code demos have the libraries imported. For user-friendliness, it's better that users can just copy and paste the code demos to have working examples. (Inspired by Material-UI documentation.)

### Potential improvement

####  1. suggestions on issue 1:

current:
```jsx
<Row className="ExampleButtons">
  <Col>
    <h3>Button Sizes</h3>  
    <p>Properties such as <code>small</code> and <code>large</code> can be added to your button in order to change its size.</p>
  </Col>
  <Col>
    <Button small>Small</Button>
    <Button>Default</Button>
    <Button large>Large</Button>
  </Col>
</Row>

```
to:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Row from "harmonium/lib/Row";
import Col from "harmonium/lib/Col";
import Button from "harmonium/lib/Button";


export default function Buttons() {

return (
<Row className="ExampleButtons">
  <Col>
    <h3>Button Sizes</h3>  
    <p>Properties such as <code>small</code> and <code>large</code> can be added to your button in order to change its size.</p>
  </Col>
  <Col>
    <Button small>Small</Button>
    <Button>Default</Button>
    <Button large>Large</Button>
  </Col>
</Row>
)}

```
